=========
Git 77   27-09-2015
Removed some obsolete code, this were some remains of experiments which I overlooked

Git 76   25-09-2015
Made some alterations in the way a back-up is made: if a backup is made onto the harddisk there is no longer a flashable copy made in the root of the harddisk. The backup is only stored in the folder "fullbackup_<type> etc.
If the backup is made onto an USB-stick then the copy is made in the root and a copy in the folder fullbackup_<type> etc.

Git 75   25-07-2015
Very small change in handling/reporting unknown device

Git 74   24-07-2015
Very small change in selecting the correct model from the list

Git 73   23-07-2015
Added some kind of support for unknown receivers. If the receiver is not found in the lookuptable the program won't be aborted but a backup will be made with some standard file naming. The user has at least to rename the folder where the backup is made.
Highly experimental but it is worth a go.
WTE gave me the idea to read some necessities from the receiver. Thanks!

Git 72   28-06-2015

Some fine tuning for the full HD skins

Git 59   21-01-2015
A first step to make the BackupSuite also useable on full HD format skins (1920*1080). 
There still has to be done some work but because of the experimental stage of the full HD skin this has, for me, a low priority at the moment.

- Some minor changes in the code (some inspired by code of Athoik)
- Some cosmetics in the lookuptable
